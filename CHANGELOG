From v0.5 to v0.51
- Music playback support.
- Music annotations engine. It reads annotations from the external CSV file and tracks them during animation.
- Music annotation example. Shows how to code animation with music playback and annotation synchronisation.
- Fixed normals corruption problem when scaling individual 3D objects.
- Added universal 1D transitions functions (line/square/cube/sin).
- RGB color blending function.
- Introduced Z_MAP.
- Modified RENDER_BUFFER to use ARGB_MAP/Z_MAP instead of the dedicated buffers.
- Support for masking/blending/adding ARGB_MAP (previously it was available only for RENDER_BUFFER).

From v0.51 to v0.52
- Dedicated struct for storing color information.
- HSL to RGB conversion, color arithmetcs functions, and corresponding example.
- Color gradient support.
- Gradient-based map generators: linear, radial, xor.
- Added alpha channel directly to ARGB_MAP and ARGB_PIXEL.
- Maps blending and fading functions.
    - Global OR per-pixel blending/fading parameters.
- Plasma pattern generation using relative parameters, without additional data structures.
- Map filter functions.
    - Edge detection
    - Horizontal blur
    - Vertical blur
    - Square pixelization
    - Random pixelization
- Map filters come in varieties(currently not all filters/not all varieties):
    - Global OR per-pixel filter-specific parameters.
    - RGB copy OR alpha-blended output on background map.
- Improvements to polygon rasterization code.
